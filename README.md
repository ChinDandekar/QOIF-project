# QOIF-project

This is a personal project born out of interest in the .qoif format and wanting to test my coding skills.


This project implements the barebones, primitive version of the Quite Ok Image Format developed by Dominic Szablewski. This is an alternative to the .png compression format because it is lossless. The majority of the files in here just handle the task of reading the pixels of an image, creating an image and displaying the image. They have been lifted straight from a APCS A assignment.

The qoi.java file actually handles the compressing and decompressing of the images according to this [file specification format](https://qoiformat.org/qoi-specification.pdf).

Run the qoi.java file to compress and decompress images.
